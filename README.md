🎗📊 Breast Cancer Diagnostic Analysis – Power BI Dashboard Project
1️⃣ Project Title
Breast Cancer Diagnostic Data Analysis
An Interactive Power BI Dashboard for Medical Data Insights
2️⃣ Short Description / Purpose

This project analyzes breast cancer diagnostic data to identify patterns between benign and malignant tumor cases.
The purpose of the dashboard is to understand tumor characteristics and detect key indicators that differentiate cancer types.

Using data visualization and DAX calculations, the dashboard highlights important medical metrics such as mean radius, texture, area and smoothness.
The analysis helps in understanding risk factors and supporting data-driven medical research insights.

This project demonstrates the application of data analytics in the healthcare domain.
